# Open-WebUI Migration from Svelte to React with SWC

## Project Overview
Migrate the Open-WebUI application from Svelte/SvelteKit framework to React with SWC compiler, maintaining all existing functionality while improving integration capabilities with the existing React-based microblog-lms system.

## Business Requirements
1. Complete migration from Svelte to React framework
2. Use SWC as the compiler for optimal performance
3. Maintain all existing features and functionality
4. Preserve the current UI/UX design
5. Ensure compatibility with existing backend APIs
6. Enable better integration with microblog-lms (React-based)
7. Maintain or improve current performance metrics

## Technical Requirements
1. Convert all Svelte components to React functional components
2. Migrate from SvelteKit routing to React Router
3. Replace Svelte stores with React state management (Context API/Zustand)
4. Convert Svelte reactive statements to React hooks
5. Migrate build configuration from SvelteKit to Vite + React + SWC
6. Preserve all existing API integrations
7. Maintain WebSocket connections for real-time features
8. Convert Svelte animations to React equivalents
9. Migrate all styles (CSS/SCSS) appropriately
10. Ensure proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Key Features to Migrate
1. Chat interface and conversation management
2. User authentication and session management
3. Model selection and configuration
4. File upload and processing capabilities
5. Markdown rendering with code highlighting
6. Voice input/output features
7. Settings and preferences management
8. Multi-language support (i18n)
9. Theme switching (dark/light mode)
10. WebSocket-based real-time updates

## Migration Strategy
1. Set up new React project structure with Vite and SWC
2. Create React equivalents of core components
3. Implement routing with React Router
4. Set up state management solution
5. Migrate API service layers
6. Convert UI components systematically
7. Implement authentication flow
8. Migrate utility functions and helpers
9. Set up testing framework
10. Perform comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria
1. All features working identically to Svelte version
2. No regression in performance
3. Successful integration with microblog-lms
4. All tests passing
5. Clean build with no errors
6. Proper error handling maintained
7. Accessibility features preserved

## Constraints
1. Must maintain compatibility with existing backend
2. No changes to API contracts
3. Preserve current URL structure
4. Maintain current browser support
5. Keep bundle size reasonable

## Deliverables
1. Fully functional React application
2. Updated build and deployment scripts
3. Migration documentation
4. Updated README and setup guides
5. Test suite with good coverage
